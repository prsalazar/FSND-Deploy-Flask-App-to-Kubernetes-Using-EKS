DEPLOY To Kubernetes using CodePipeline & CodeBuild
----------------------------------------------------

1) Generate a GitHub access token. A Github acces token will allow CodePipeline
to monitor when a repo is changed. A token can be generated here. You should generate
the token with full control of private repositories, as shown in the image below. Be sure
to save the token somewhere that is secure.

Github Access Token: <token here>


2) The file buildspec.yml instructs CodeBuild. We need a way to pass your jwt secret to
the app in kubernetes securly. You will be using AWS Parameter Store to do this. First
add the following to your buildspec.yml file:

    env:
      parameter-store:         
        JWT_SECRET: JWT_SECRET
        
This lets CodeBuild know to set an evironment variable based on a value in the parameter-store.

3) Put secret into AWS Parameter Store
    aws.cmd ssm put-parameter --name JWT_SECRET --value "HenryTheWeinerDog" --type SecureString

4) Modify CloudFormation template.

There is file named ci-cd-codepipeline.cfn.yml, this the the template file you will use to create
your CodePipeline pipeline. Open this file and go to the 'Parameters' section. These are parameters
that will accept values when you create a stack. Fill in the 'Default' value for the following:

EksClusterName : use the name of the EKS cluster you created above
GitSourceRepo : use the name of your project's github repo.
GitHubUser : use your github user name
KubectlRoleName : use the name of the role you created for kubectl above
Save this file.

5) Create a stack for CodePipeline

    - Go the the CloudFormation service in the aws console.
    - Press the 'Create Stack' button.
    - Choose the 'Upload template to S3' option and upload the template file 'ci-cd-codepipeline.cfn.yml'
    - Press 'Next'. Give the stack a name, fill in your GitHub login and the Github access token generated in step 1.
    - Confirm the cluster name matches your cluster, the 'kubectl IAM role' matches the role you created above,
      and the repository matches the name of your forked repo.
    - Create the stack.

You can check it's status in the CloudFormation console.

6) Check the pipeline works. Once the stack is successfully created, commit a change to the master branch
   of your github repo. Then, in the aws console go to the CodePipeline UI. You should see that the build
   is running.

7) To test your api endpoints, get the external ip for your service:

    kubectl get services simple-jwt-api -o wide

NAME             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                                                              PORT(S)        AGE   SELECTOR
simple-jwt-api   LoadBalancer   10.100.143.136   a425533e8483e11ea86f50aa3912fa0f-331931887.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com   80:30731/TCP   2m52s   app=simple-jwt-api
    Now use the external ip url to test the app:

    export TOKEN=`curl -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"1234"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST a425533e8483e11ea86f50aa3912fa0f-331931887.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/auth  | jq -r '.token'`
    curl --request GET 'a425533e8483e11ea86f50aa3912fa0f-331931887.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/contents' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | jq 

8) Save the external IP above

9) to delete stacks, first delete VPC's otherwise stack delete will fail.
